# 🎨 Pixel Art Practice

Hi there! 👋

This is a small personal repository where I share my **pixel art practices**.  
I'm not a professional artist (in fact, I'm pretty new to this), but I enjoy drawing and want to improve over time. Sometimes I draw daily, sometimes weekly or monthly — just whenever I can.

Most of the work here is just **practice**, not polished or perfect, but it's part of my learning journey.

Lately I am focusing more on practicing drwaing with pen and paper rather than pixelart due to my studies. It is hard to manage school with two hobbies drawing and pixel art so I deacided to practice pixel art later

## 🗂 What's Inside

- Simple pixel art sketches
- Sprites, tiles, and small scenes
- Animations (sometimes)
- Random experiments and tests

## 🧑‍🎨 Why I'm Doing This

Because drawing is fun — even when I'm not great at it.  
And because I want to get better.  
That's all.

## 📥 Can You Use These?

Sure! Everything here is free to download and use in your own projects if you find something useful.  
You don’t have to give credit (these are just practice pieces), but if you do — thank you! It would honestly make my day to know someone liked my work enough to use it.
